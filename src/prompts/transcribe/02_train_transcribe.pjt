Ok, in this channel, I will paste in a transcription of a Dungeons and Dragons session audio recording.  This is a sample:

===================
It looks like there's, like, one large barn, and the second one looks to be this kind of small two-story house.
Pretty, like, small and unremarkable in most ways, but it does match the description we were going for.
The one thing that is a little bit notable is that there appears to be a significant hole in the roof of the barn that it, but yeah, as you're going over it, you don't, otherwise it seems pretty much just dead silent as you're approaching its place.
So, I guess we head to the barn?
Yeah, the truth is, are the barn or the main, like, house structure, by the way?
Well, I'm kind of curious of what's the barn, but I guess if he's probably going to be in the house, then maybe it's something the barn just broke for normal reasons that aren't sinister.
No, interesting.
I would probably sit there and watch for a little bit just to see if I sense that the number is still, you know, a couple hundred feet away.
Sure.
Sometimes it's a roll for perception or something.
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and roll for perception.
Which one was that?
Twenty.
Yeah, it had to be twenty.
Pretty much it'll always, it's going to be twenty.
Eighteen.
Eighteen.
What's your perception?
It doesn't have to be modifier.
Is that over here?
Perception, I think it's that one.
Persuasion?
That's perception.
That's persuasion.
Where is perception?
Perception's there, so just plus one.
Perception.
So it's nineteen.
Nineteen.
Nice.
Very good.
Yeah, so as you're going over, so the first thing you notice is that as you're going over, it is very still.
There is, you're not seeing like any movement.
And something that seems related to that, it actually seems to try to get much more relevant.
For given this is, these types of barns usually have livestock, there is no sand.
Yeah, it sounds like it's dead.
=================

And I'd like you to classify each line (and add a "PREFIX: " to the start of each line:
- OUTGAME/{PERSON NAME} - something asking questions about how D&D works, or not even related
- GAMEMECH/{PERSON NAME} - something with D&D game mechanics discussion like rolling dice, discussing how many hits points a guy has, or what kind of modifier or weapons someone has
- NARRATIVE/{PERSON NAME} - Something in the game describing what a character looks, like what they are doing (but not what they are saying)
- DIALOGUE/{PERSON NAME} - what a game character is actually saying in character.  
- BACKGROUND/{PERSON NAME} - discussing the background of a character, his alignment, or explaining something about the current world setting that the characters or DM should know

If you don't know the name use UNKNOWN as the person name.  So my example above would look like:

Do you think you could attempt to label a conversation from D&D based on the context of what we are talking about?  I just want a Yes or no for now.  I will start pasting in conversation content, after I've confirmed you understand
