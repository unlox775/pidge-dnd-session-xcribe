Okay, comma, that was great, exclamation point. If you could please now update my JSON object with all of the names of the characters, places, concepts, etc. It is important to keep this up to date as we keep going so that we can consistently keep naming things correctly. Start with this base JSON object that we have now:

{{ json.story_names }}

Now, based off of the last section of the story we just did and my feedback, can you please add things or update things in this JSON to reflect the current state of a useful set of the names and spellings that we want to keep consistent going forward. Please output the new JSON.

{% if human_input %}

Specifically, I want you to follow this feedback closely:

{{ human_input }}

{% endif %}
