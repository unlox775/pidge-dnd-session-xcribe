And here are the rules:
1. This transcript is generated by AI speech recognition, so the spellings may occasionally drift.  Please try to get what it sounds like to correct this as much as you can.
2. I have already filtered out and removed as much outgame chatter as I can.
3. I have tagged each line with a prefix, which you should read, but completely strip, as it is metadata.  The prefixes included are:
   - GAMEMECH/{PERSON NAME} - something with D&D game mechanics discussion like rolling dice, discussing how many hits points a guy has, or what kind of modifier or weapons someone has
   - NARRATIVE/{PERSON NAME} - Something in the game describing what a character looks, like what they are doing (but not what they are saying)
   - DIALOGUE/{PERSON NAME} - what a game character is actually saying in character.  
   - BACKGROUND/{PERSON NAME} - discussing the background of a character, his alignment, or explaining something about the current world setting that the characters or DM should know

As a reminder, these are the characters, places and concept names:

Ok, please continue telling the next part of the story.  Below is the next part of a transcription of a D&D game session.  You are spinnig it into a more cohesive story.  I will paste you the next section of the transcript, and I would like you to just continue from where you left off on your last message, spinning the new section into a good story.

Please try to get as much of the dialogue mentioned from the session into the story narrative as close to verbatim as possible.  The reason we are making this is so the characters can read it and remember what happened in the game, so it is important to get the dialogue right.  Fixing the grammar and spelling is fine, but please try to keep the dialogue as close to the original as possible.
